# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
     - assets/icons/
     - assets/fonts/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: CustomIcon
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/icons/CustomIcon.ttf

     - family: CustomIcon2
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/icons/CustomIcon2.ttf


     - family: CustomIcon3
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/icons/CustomIcon3.ttf
     - family: CustomIcon4
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/icons/CustomIcon4.ttf
     - family: CustomIcon5
